I have been working as a developer for over 4 years. Having worked on hundreds of projects with a variety of businesses, I have developed a knack for understanding what each business needs for their digital presence, and how to implement most suited solutions in a cost-effective manner. In my free time I enjoy hiking the hills and visiting natural parks.
